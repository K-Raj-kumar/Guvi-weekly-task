Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Introduction

The internet is an integral part of our lives, and the way websites communicate with our browsers has evolved over the years. Two major versions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) have played a significant role in this evolution: HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. In this blog post, we'll explore the key differences between these two versions in a simple and easy-to-understand manner.

**HTTP/1.1: The Old Standard**

HTTP/1.1, born in 1997, has faithfully served the web for many years. However, it had some limitations that prompted the development of HTTP/2.

1. **One Request at a Time**: In HTTP/1.1, each request-response cycle happened one at a time. This means that when your browser requested a webpage, it would wait for each resource (like images, stylesheets, and scripts) to be delivered one after the other. This made web pages load slowly, especially on high-latency connections.

2. **Resource Bottlenecks**: The "Head of Line Blocking" problem in HTTP/1.1 meant that if one resource took longer to load, it held up the loading of other resources, causing delays in rendering web pages.

3. **No Built-in Compression**: HTTP/1.1 did not compress headers, making them larger than necessary and leading to increased data transfer times.

**HTTP/2: A Faster, More Efficient Web**

HTTP/2, introduced in 2015, was designed to address these limitations and offer a better web experience.

1. **Multiplexing**: The most significant change in HTTP/2 is the ability to send multiple requests and responses simultaneously over a single connection. This means resources can load in parallel, reducing page load times significantly.

2. **Header Compression**: HTTP/2 uses header compression, which means fewer bytes are transmitted for headers, reducing overhead and speeding up communication.

3. **Prioritization**: HTTP/2 allows for resource prioritization. This means more critical resources can be loaded before less important ones, enhancing web page rendering.

4. **Server Push**: HTTP/2 enables the server to send resources it thinks the browser will need, eliminating the need for additional requests and reducing latency.

5. **Binary Protocol**: While HTTP/1.1 used plain text for communication, HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol that's more efficient to parse, leading to fewer errors and quicker data transmission.

**Conclusion: Why HTTP/2 Matters**

In a nutshell, HTTP/2 was designed to make web browsing faster and more efficient. It does this by allowing multiple resources to load simultaneously, compressing headers, prioritizing critical resources, and even predicting what your browser needs. While HTTP/1.1 served us well for years, HTTP/2 offers a better web experience, especially on today's complex and resource-rich websites.
